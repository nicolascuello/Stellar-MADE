# Stellar-MADE project

We plan to work on 4 main axes during the meeting: 
- Distribution, environment and evolution of discs: multiples vs. singles.
- Disc diagnostics (morphology, kinematics and accretion) within multiples.
- Dust evolution in multiples and flybys: G/D ratio, radial drift, traps, asymmetries.
- Strategy to better characterise discs and orbits with new generation facilities.

All these topics explicitly overlap and will be discussed during the meeting. Each participant will preferentially work on one item with a subgroup of participants. At the end, we will establish a plan to keep working together after the meeting, share results efficiently, and co-write the corresponding scientific articles.

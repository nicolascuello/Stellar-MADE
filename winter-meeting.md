# Stellar-MADE project

We plan to work on 3 main axes during the Winter Meeting:
- Formation and observation of discs in multiple systems;  
- Dust dynamics and grain growth in protoplanetary discs;  
- Stability and evolution in multiple stellar systems.  

We will also seek new connections between two different fields: "black holes and gravitational waves" & "disc dynamics and planet formation".

Each participant will preferentially work on one or several items with a subgroup of participants. At the end, we will establish a plan to keep working together after the meeting, share results efficiently, and co-write the corresponding scientific articles.

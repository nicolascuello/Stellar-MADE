# Stellar-MADE project

We plan to work on 3 main axes during the Winter Meeting:
- Flybys, environmental effects & infall on within multiple stellar systems;  
- Dust dynamics, grain growth & observations of protoplanetary discs;  
- Multi-planetary architectures in multiple stellar systems.

Each participant will preferentially work on one or several items with a subgroup of participants. At the end, we will establish a plan to keep working together after the meeting, share results efficiently, and co-write the corresponding scientific articles.
